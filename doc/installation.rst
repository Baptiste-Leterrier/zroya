Installation
============

Zroya is being developed with ``pypiwin32`` as only requirement. 

.. code-block:: python

    pip install pypiwin32

If you install zroya from PyPi, all requirements should be installed with just one line:

.. code-block:: python

    pip install zroya

Or you may close github repository and install zroya locally:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/malja/zroya.git

That is all. See :ref:`basic_usage` for basic examples of usage.
